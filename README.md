- Provides different sets of responses based on the recognized keywords.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

4. The chatbot will welcome you and prompt you for input.

5. Enter your message or query related to real estate.

6. The chatbot will generate a response based on the recognized keywords and predefined patterns.

## Customization

You can customize the chatbot by modifying the predefined patterns, greetings, and responses. Here are some possible modifications:

- Add more greetings or modify the existing greetings in the `greetings` list.
